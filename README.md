## Problem

Agriculture is a critical sector, and farmers often face challenges related to crop management, financial decisions, and timely identification of plant diseases. Lack of access to accurate information can lead to reduced yields and financial hardships. To address these issues, we present the Kisan Mitra app, designed to empower farmers with an AI-powered assistant and plant disease detection mechanism.

## Solutions

### AI-powered Assistant

The Kisan Mitra app provides farmers with a virtual assistant powered by OpenAI, capable of answering queries related to agriculture and finance. This feature aims to bridge the information gap and assist farmers in making informed decisions about crop management, financial planning, and other aspects of farming.

### Plant Disease Detection Mechanism

The app incorporates an AI-powered plant disease detection mechanism to identify diseases at an early stage. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, the app analyzes images of crops to detect potential diseases accurately. Once a disease is identified, the app suggests the best remedies, enabling farmers to take proactive measures and mitigate crop damage.
